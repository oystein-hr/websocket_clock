# Minimal websocket app
### Runtime environment
OS: Mac OS  
Python version: 3.8.1  
Browser: Chrome  

### About this app
I want to use HTML, CSS and JS as front-end for Python apps, so as a part of 
learning it I made this mini project that updates the page without needing to 
refresh the browser. It also detects when the page is closed and then exits the back-end app.  

### Disclaimer
This is only tested on mac os, and the path for the html code will probably not work on Windows.
I am also a beginner when it comes to programming, so it is probably not optimal code ;)
