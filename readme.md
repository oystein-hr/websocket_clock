# Minimal websocket app
### Runtime environment
**OS:** macOS  
**Python version:** 3.8.1
**Python libraries:** websockets 8.1  
**Browser:** Chrome  

### About this app
I want to use HTML, CSS and JS as front-end for Python apps, so as a part of 
learning it I made this mini project that updates the page without needing to 
refresh the browser. It also detects when the page is closed and then exits the back-end app.  

### Disclaimer
This is only tested on mac os, and the path for the html code is not tested on a Windows system yet,
but in theory it should work because of the **pathlib** library that now is in Python 3.
I am also a beginner when it comes to programming, so it is probably not optimal code ;)
